 The game genre is action and it's interactive meaning during the course of the game you will be presented with multiple choices each choice will lead to different outcome be careful with your choice since some will end with death. 
 ### Objective of our game
 
 When we created the game we thought about what former president Bill Clinton said on Jimmy Kimmel live when talking about aliens:"it may be the only way to unite this increasingly divided world of ours," and by it he meant aliens invasion from outer space." 
 

 
 so the purpose of the game to give the idea to the player that as human's disparity or racism or whatever shouldnt be part of our life and we should think of each other as we are thinking about our selves
